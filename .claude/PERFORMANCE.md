# Performance & Session Management

**Purpose:** Optimize Claude Code performance, manage tokens efficiently, and avoid common pitfalls.

---

## ðŸ”„ Session Lifecycle Management

### When to `/clear`

**Use `/clear` to reset context after:**

```bash
# After completing a feature
git commit -m "feat: user authentication"
/clear  # Start fresh for next feature

# Between unrelated tasks
"Implement login" â†’ /clear â†’ "Fix navbar bug"

# When context gets polluted (>50 messages)
/clear  # Fresh start improves accuracy

# Before starting complex multi-step work
/clear  # Clean slate for better planning
```

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Faster responses (less context to process)
- âœ… Better accuracy (no conflicting information)
- âœ… Lower token costs
- âœ… Prevents context drift

**Rule of Thumb:** `/clear` after every commit or feature completion.

---

### When to `/compact`

**Use `/compact` for long sessions that you want to continue:**

```bash
# After implementing 3+ related features
"Added login, signup, password reset... getting long"
/compact "keep authentication implementation details, remove debugging attempts"

# Before planning next phase
/compact "summarize current architecture decisions"

# When approaching token limits
/compact "keep only essential context"
```

**Syntax:**
```bash
/compact                          # Auto-summarize entire conversation
/compact "keep X, remove Y"       # With custom instructions
```

**Use Case:**
- Long debugging sessions with multiple attempts
- Multi-day feature development
- Complex refactoring with many iterations

---

### When to `/cos`

**Check session costs and duration:**

```bash
/cos  # Shows: Token usage, API cost, session duration
```

**Use `/cos`:**
- Before `/compact` (decide if needed)
- After large operations (check token usage)
- For budget tracking

---

## ðŸ¤– Model Selection Guide

### Sonnet (Default) - 90% of Tasks

**Use Sonnet for:**
- âœ… Feature implementation (CRUD, API endpoints)
- âœ… Bug fixes and debugging
- âœ… Test writing (PHPUnit, Vitest, Playwright)
- âœ… Code review and refactoring
- âœ… Documentation updates
- âœ… Frontend work (Vue, Inertia, TailwindCSS)

**Why Sonnet:**
- Fast responses (better DX)
- Cost-efficient (10x cheaper than Opus)
- Excellent for Laravel/Vue patterns
- Sufficient for 90% of development tasks

**Current PineCMS Agent Config:**
- All 14 agents use **Sonnet** (PR #6)
- `fullstack-developer` switched from Opus â†’ Sonnet for efficiency

---

### Opus - Complex Architecture Only

**Use Opus for:**
- ðŸ”´ Critical architecture decisions (security, scalability)
- ðŸ”´ Complex algorithm design (performance-critical code)
- ðŸ”´ Multi-system integration planning
- ðŸ”´ Database schema migrations with data transformations

**Why Opus:**
- Deeper reasoning capability
- Better for novel problems (not seen in training)
- More thorough edge case analysis

**How to Switch:**
```bash
claude --model opus  # Start session with Opus

# Or in agent config (.claude/agents/*.md)
model: opus  # Change from sonnet
```

**PineCMS Policy:**
- Default to Sonnet
- Only use Opus when explicitly needed
- Document reason in commit message

## âš¡ Token Efficiency Tips

### 1. Plan Before Implementing

```bash
# Bad: Jump straight into coding
"Build user authentication system"
[Claude writes 500 lines without plan, misses requirements]

# Good: Use Plan Mode first
Shift+Tab â†’ "think" â†’ Plan authentication system
[Claude plans, you review, then implement efficiently]
```

**Token Savings:** 30-50% (avoid rewrites)

---

### 2. Use Specialized Agents

```bash
# Bad: Main session does everything
"Review code, write tests, deploy to production"
[Main session gets polluted with mixed concerns]

# Good: Delegate to agents
code-reviewer â†’ Review code
test-engineer â†’ Write tests
deployment-engineer â†’ Production deploy
```

**Token Savings:** 40-60% (agents have focused context)

---

### 3. Break Large Tasks into Chunks

```bash
# Bad: "Implement entire CMS admin panel"
[Claude generates 50 files, misses requirements, needs rework]

# Good: Iterative approach
1. "Create Post CRUD (backend only)" â†’ Test â†’ Commit
2. "Create Post admin UI (Vue)" â†’ Test â†’ Commit
3. "Add media upload to posts" â†’ Test â†’ Commit
```

**Token Savings:** 50-70% (fewer rewrites, better results)

---

### 4. Keep Sessions Focused

```bash
# Bad: Context switching mid-session
"Fix login bug" â†’ "Oh, also refactor navbar" â†’ "And update docs"
[Context gets polluted, responses degrade]

# Good: One task at a time
"Fix login bug" â†’ /clear â†’ "Refactor navbar" â†’ /clear â†’ "Update docs"
```

**Token Savings:** 20-30% (cleaner context)

---

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: Slow Responses

**Symptoms:**
- Responses take >30 seconds
- Long "thinking" pauses

**Solutions:**
```bash
/clear             # Reset context
/compact           # Summarize if needed
Break into chunks  # Smaller, focused requests
```

---

### Issue #2: Context Pollution

**Symptoms:**
- Claude forgets earlier decisions
- Contradictory suggestions
- Degraded code quality

**Solutions:**
```bash
/clear                    # Fresh start
/compact "keep X only"    # Selective summarization
```

**Prevention:**
- `/clear` after every commit
- Keep sessions under 50 messages
- Use agents for complex multi-step work

---

### Issue #3: Token Overflow

**Symptoms:**
- "Context length exceeded" errors
- Truncated responses

**Solutions:**
```bash
/clear                    # Immediate fix
/compact                  # If need to preserve context
--max-turns 5            # Limit for focused tasks
```

**Prevention:**
- Monitor with `/cos`
- Use Plan Mode for complex tasks
- Delegate to specialized agents

---

### Issue #4: Repetitive Mistakes

**Symptoms:**
- Claude repeats same error
- Forgets project conventions

**Solutions:**
```bash
/clear                              # Reset mental model
Use vibe_learn to log patterns      # Pattern learning
Update .claude/instructions/*.md    # Document conventions
```

**Prevention:**
- Document patterns in `.claude/instructions/`
- Use `vibe_learn` MCP tool for mistake tracking
- Update skill-rules.json for auto-activation

## ðŸ“Š Session Management Best Practices

### Optimal Session Lifecycle

```
1. Start Fresh
   â†“
2. Plan (if complex) - Shift+Tab
   â†“
3. Implement (focused, 1 task)
   â†“
4. Test & Review
   â†“
5. Commit
   â†“
6. /clear (ALWAYS)
   â†“
7. Repeat
```

---

### Performance Checklist

**Before Starting:**
- [ ] `/clear` from previous session
- [ ] Plan complex tasks (Shift+Tab)
- [ ] Check which agent to use

**During Work:**
- [ ] Keep sessions focused (1 feature/task)
- [ ] Monitor with `/cos` if session gets long
- [ ] `/compact` if >50 messages

**After Completion:**
- [ ] Test implementation
- [ ] Commit changes
- [ ] `/clear` for next task

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

```bash
# Session Management
/clear          # Reset context (use after every commit)
/compact        # Summarize long sessions
/cos            # Check token usage and cost

# Model Selection
--model sonnet  # Default (90% of tasks)
--model opus    # Complex architecture only

# Token Efficiency
Shift+Tab       # Plan before implementing (saves 30-50% tokens)
Use agents      # Delegate complex tasks (saves 40-60% tokens)
Break chunks    # Iterative approach (saves 50-70% tokens)
```
