# Agent Performance Monitoring

**Purpose:** Track agent effectiveness and model performance to optimize the PineCMS development workflow.

---

## 📊 Current Agent Configuration

### Model Assignments (as of 2025-10-31)

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| fullstack-developer | **sonnet** | Changed from opus for cost efficiency (PR #6) |
| backend-architect | sonnet | Laravel-specific, focused scope |
| frontend-developer | sonnet | Vue/Inertia, focused scope |
| task-decomposition-expert | sonnet | Planning, no code execution |
| code-reviewer | sonnet | Review, no code execution |
| test-engineer | sonnet | Testing patterns, repetitive |
| debugger | sonnet | Debugging, focused scope |
| error-detective | sonnet | Log analysis, pattern matching |
| database-architect | sonnet | Schema design, focused |
| security-auditor | sonnet | Security patterns, checklists |
| deployment-engineer | sonnet | DevOps, focused scope |
| context-manager | sonnet | Context tracking |
| architect-reviewer | sonnet | Architecture review |
| ui-ux-designer | sonnet | Design review |

## 🎯 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### 1. Task Completion Rate
- ✅ **Target:** >90% successful completion without user intervention
- 📝 **Measurement:** Tasks completed / Tasks assigned
- 🚨 **Red flag:** <80% completion rate

### 2. Context Efficiency
- ✅ **Target:** <50k tokens per complex task
- 📝 **Measurement:** Avg tokens used / Task completion
- 🚨 **Red flag:** >100k tokens for simple tasks

### 3. Error Rate
- ✅ **Target:** <5% code errors requiring fixes
- 📝 **Measurement:** Errors found in code review / Total implementations
- 🚨 **Red flag:** >10% error rate

### 4. Agent Specialization Score
- ✅ **Target:** Agent completes task within its domain without escalation
- 📝 **Measurement:** Tasks completed independently / Total tasks
- 🚨 **Red flag:** Frequent task escalation or agent confusion

## 🔬 Experiments & Hypotheses

### Experiment #1: Sonnet for Full-Stack Development
**Date:** 2025-10-31 (PR #6)
**Hypothesis:** Sonnet can handle full-stack tasks effectively, reducing costs vs. Opus
**Previous:** fullstack-developer used Opus
**Change:** Switched to Sonnet
**Reason:** Cost efficiency while maintaining quality

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Completes Laravel + Vue + Inertia implementations correctly
- ✅ No increase in error rate vs. Opus
- ✅ Generates proper Laravel 12 patterns
- ✅ Uses MCP tools effectively (laravel-boost, context7, vibe-check)

**Monitoring Period:** 30 days (Until 2025-11-30)

**Metrics to Track:**
- [ ] Task completion rate for full-stack features
- [ ] Error rate in code reviews
- [ ] Quality of Laravel/Vue implementations
- [ ] MCP tool usage effectiveness
- [ ] Token efficiency vs. Opus baseline

**Decision Point (2025-11-30):**
- If successful → Keep Sonnet
- If unsuccessful → Revert to Opus or try Haiku for simple tasks

#### fullstack-developer (sonnet)
- **Tasks Assigned:** _TBD_
- **Tasks Completed:** _TBD_
- **Completion Rate:** _TBD_
- **Error Rate:** _TBD_
- **Notable Success:** _TBD_
- **Notable Failure:** _TBD_
- **Avg Tokens/Task:** _TBD_

#### backend-architect (sonnet)
- **Tasks Assigned:** _TBD_
- **Tasks Completed:** _TBD_
- **Completion Rate:** _TBD_
- **Error Rate:** _TBD_
- **Notable Success:** _TBD_
- **Notable Failure:** _TBD_

- **Tasks Completed:** _TBD_
- **Completion Rate:** _TBD_
- **MCP tool usage:** _TBD_ (vibe_check, laravel-boost)
- **Planning Quality:** _TBD_

## 🧪 Testing Methodology

### 1. Baseline Testing (Week 1)
Run agents on known tasks with established solutions:
- **fullstack-developer:** Implement blog post CRUD (known pattern)
- **backend-architect:** Design user roles system (known pattern)
- **test-engineer:** Write tests for authentication (known pattern)

**Purpose:** Establish baseline performance metrics

### 2. Real-World Testing (Week 2-4)
Deploy agents on actual PineCMS development tasks:
- Track completion rates
- Monitor error rates
- Review code quality
- Measure token usage

### 3. A/B Testing (If needed)
If Sonnet performance is borderline:
- Split tasks 50/50 between Sonnet and Opus
- Compare quality, speed, cost
- Make data-driven decision

## 🚨 Red Flags & Actions

| Red Flag | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Completion rate <80% | Investigate task complexity, adjust agent scope |
| Error rate >10% | Review agent instructions, add examples |
| Frequent MCP tool failures | Check tool permissions, update documentation |
| Token usage >100k for simple tasks | Optimize agent instructions, reduce verbosity |
| Agent confusion (wrong tool usage) | Clarify agent responsibilities, improve descriptions |

## 🎓 Best Practices Discovered

### Agent Selection
- ✅ Use **task-decomposition-expert** first for complex features
- ✅ Use **fullstack-developer** for end-to-end implementations
- ✅ Use **code-reviewer** after EVERY significant code change
- ⚠️ Avoid switching agents mid-task (context loss)

### MCP Tool Usage
- ✅ Always use `search-docs` before implementing Laravel features
- ✅ Use `vibe_check` for complex features (3+ files)
- ✅ Use `vibe_learn` to log mistakes immediately
- ✅ Use `tinker` for debugging Eloquent queries

### Agent Efficiency
- ✅ Provide clear, specific task descriptions
- ✅ Include acceptance criteria in task description
- ✅ Reference similar existing code when available
- ⚠️ Break large tasks into smaller chunks
