# Code Review Commands

Proactive code review workflow to catch errors early.
Based on: "Claude Code is a Beast - Tips from 6 Months" Reddit post.

## /code-review - Architectural Code Review

Launch the `code-reviewer` agent to review recently changed code for:
- Best practices adherence
- Architecture consistency
- Security flaws
- Missing implementations
- Code quality issues

**When to use:**
- After implementing a feature or significant changes
- Before creating a PR
- Periodically during long implementation sessions
- When you want a "second pair of eyes"

**Process:**
1. Identify files changed in current session (use git status/diff)
2. Launch `code-reviewer` agent with context about what was implemented
3. Agent reviews code against:
   - `.claude/instructions/` (backend, frontend, security, architecture)
   - Project patterns and conventions
   - SOLID principles
   - Laravel/Vue best practices
4. Return detailed review with:
   - Critical issues (must fix)
   - Warnings (should fix)
   - Suggestions (nice to have)
   - Positive feedback (what's done well)

**Agent prompt:**
```
Please review the following files that were recently modified:

[List of changed files]

Context:
[Brief description of what was implemented]

Check for:
- Adherence to project patterns (Services, Repositories, Events, etc.)
- Security issues (XSS, SQL injection, CSRF, etc.)
- Missing error handling
- N+1 query problems
- Inconsistent code style
- Missing tests
- Architecture violations
- Any other issues you notice

Provide specific feedback with file:line references.
```

## /build-and-fix - Run Builds & Fix All Errors

Systematically run all build checks and fix errors until clean.

**When to use:**
- Before committing code
- After completing a feature
- When you suspect there might be errors
- Before creating a PR

**Process:**
1. **TypeScript Check** (if frontend modified):
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **PHPStan Check** (if backend modified):
   ```bash
   composer analyse
   ```

3. **For each error found:**
   - Show error
   - Explain what's wrong
   - Fix it
   - Re-run check to verify

4. **If > 10 errors:**
   - Consider launching `debugger` agent
   - Work through errors systematically

5. **Final verification:**
   ```bash
   composer quality  # PHP: format + analyze + test
   npm run quality   # JS: format + lint + type-check + test
   ```

---

## /quick-quality - Quick Quality Check

Fast quality check without full test suite (useful during development).

**Process:**
```bash
# Backend
vendor/bin/pint --dirty  # Format changed files only
composer analyse         # PHPStan

# Frontend
npx prettier --write $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(vue|ts|js)$')
npx eslint $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.(vue|ts|js)$')
npx tsc --noEmit
```

**Output:**
- ✅ All checks passed → Ready to commit
- ❌ Errors found → Fix and re-run

## /pr-ready - Full Pre-PR Checklist

Complete checklist before creating a Pull Request.

**Checklist:**
```markdown
## Code Quality

- [ ] `npm run quality` passes
- [ ] No console.log statements
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No debug code

## Testing

## Workflow Example

### During Feature Development
```
[Implementing user authentication for 2 hours...]

You: /code-review

Claude: [Launches code-reviewer agent]

Agent: Reviewed 8 modified files. Found:

CRITICAL (must fix):
- app/Services/AuthService.php:42
  Missing try-catch around Socialite call. Could expose errors to users.

WARNINGS (should fix):
- resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue:28
  API call not wrapped in error handling. Consider adding toast notification.

SUGGESTIONS (nice to have):
- app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php
  Consider extracting validation to FormRequest class for better organization.

POSITIVE:
- Good use of Repository pattern
- Event-Driven architecture followed correctly
- Proper type hints throughout

Claude: Shall I fix the critical and warning issues?
```

### Before Committing
```
You: /build-and-fix

Claude: Running TypeScript check...
✅ TypeScript: No errors

Running PHPStan...
❌ PHPStan: 3 errors found

Error 1:
Parameter #1 $user of method AuthService::sendWelcomeEmail() expects App\Models\User, App\Models\User|null given.

Fix: Adding null check before sendWelcomeEmail() call

[Fixes error]

Running PHPStan again...
✅ PHPStan: No errors

All checks passed! ✅
```

### Before PR
```
You: /pr-ready

Claude: Running pre-PR checklist...

✅ composer quality passes
✅ npm run quality passes
❌ Found console.log in resources/js/Pages/Auth/Login.vue:15
✅ No commented-out code
✅ All tests pass
⚠️  No tests added for AuthService

Shall I:
1. Remove the console.log
2. Create tests for AuthService
```

## Best Practices from Reddit Post

1. **Review often during implementation**
   - Don't wait until the end
   - Catch big mistakes early
   - Saves headaches later

2. **Have Claude review its own code**
   - Use the `code-reviewer` agent
   - Gets a fresh perspective
   - Catches things you both might miss

3. **Never commit without quality checks**
   - Always run `/build-and-fix` minimum
   - Run `/pr-ready` before PRs
   - Zero errors left behind (#NoMessLeftBehind)

4. **Systematic error fixing**
   - Don't skip errors thinking they're "unrelated"
   - Fix them all, every time
   - Use the hooks system to catch them automatically

---

## Integration with Hooks

The Stop hook automatically runs build checks after you finish responding.
You'll see errors immediately without having to manually run checks.

**Hook benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic error detection
- ✅ No errors slip through
- ✅ Gentle reminders for error handling
- ✅ Zero manual checking needed

**Manual commands still useful for:**
- Full quality check with tests (`/pr-ready`)
- Systematic error fixing (`/build-and-fix`)
- Architecture review (`/code-review`)
