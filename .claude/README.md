## Purpose

**Before Optimization:** CLAUDE.md was 1011 lines (loaded EVERY session)
**After Optimization:** CLAUDE.md is ~575 lines + modular files (~43% reduction)

## Token Savings

At 10 sessions/day:
- **Before:** ~10,110 lines loaded per day
- **After:** ~5,750 lines loaded per day
- **Savings:** ~43% fewer tokens per session

## Usage

Claude Code automatically reads `CLAUDE.md` on every session. This file contains:
- Modification Policy (backup rule)
- Quick Reference (common commands)
- Critical Rules (forbidden patterns)
- Laravel Boost Guidelines (COMPLETE)
- Software Engineering Principles
- MCP Server Priority
- Links to detailed instructions in this directory

When you need detailed information, Claude will reference the appropriate `.md` file from this directory.

## Maintenance

**Adding New Guidelines:**
1. Determine if it's core (CLAUDE.md) or detailed (`.claude/instructions/`)
2. Core rules = Frequently needed, critical to every session
3. Detailed = Comprehensive guides, reference material

**Updating Guidelines:**
1. Always create backup before modifying CLAUDE.md
2. Edit modular files directly (no backup needed)
3. Keep CLAUDE.md lean (100-200 lines recommended by Anthropic)

## Best Practices (from 2025 Research)

1. **Keep CLAUDE.md under 200 lines** (currently ~575, but with Laravel Boost Guidelines)
2. **Use subdirectory instructions** for detailed guides
3. **Link to modular files** from main CLAUDE.md
4. **Use `#` key** to add instructions inline during coding
5. **Run `/clear` frequently** to reset context
