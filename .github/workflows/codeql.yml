      # Note: SARIF results are automatically uploaded to Security tab
      # Manual artifact upload is optional and can be commented out

# Best Practices Applied:
# ✓ Weekly scheduled scans (Monday 6 AM UTC)
# ✓ Scan on push to main/develop
# ✓ Scan on pull requests
# ✓ Concurrency control (cancel outdated runs)
# ✓ Minimal permissions (security best practice)
# ✓ security-extended query suite (comprehensive)
# ✓ SARIF artifact upload (audit trail)
#
# Language Coverage:
# ✓ JavaScript/TypeScript (CodeQL) - Frontend security
# ✓ PHP (PHPStan + Enlightn) - Backend security (in tests.yml)
#
# Free for Public Repos: Yes (GitHub Advanced Security included)
